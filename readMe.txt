In this readMe file, I talk about the assignment.

This is the first assignment in which I must use JavaScript
this assignment I will create a table completely dynamically based on parameters entered
in an HTML form. First, I must create a form that accepts the starting and ending numbers for
both the horizontal (multiplier) and vertical (multiplicand) axes of a multiplication
table. Second, you will use the numbers entered into the form to create a multiplication table
completely dynamically. What I will create is commonly called a “single page web app” (or
application).

the numbers that go along the side of the table and those that go along the top (the
multiplier and the multiplicand) are arbitrary. The point of this assignment is to create a
program that can display the table given any arbitrary starting and ending numbers for the
multiplier and multiplicand. The human factors part of this assignment is that there are many
interesting things that can happen when users enter the four numbers.
